    1st approach: Topological Ordering in DFS

    1. create a list to save to children for each node
    2. for each node, put the children in
        e.g. [4, 3], [1, 0], [5, 2], [5, 4], [5, 1], [2, 3]
        children list = [[], [0], [3], [], [3], [2,4,1]]
    3. use a hashtable to store the visited node, 1=visiting, 2=visited
    4. use a stack to store the nodes which no longer has unvisited children
    5. the result is the stack in the reversed order
