    questions to ask:
    - duplicate words? maybe
    - if a word cannot be splited, is it a compound word? no, it is not so dont put it into the result

    1st approach: slicing + hashtable (dynamic programming)

    Time    < O(n*2^k) k: average number of characters of words, but since we use hashtable, it must be smaller
    Space   < O(2^k) the recursion tree, but since we use hashtable, it must be smaller
