    1st approach: bfs + math
    - do math to calculate the position of a node in the full binary tree
        left = position*2 + 0
        right = position*2 + 1
    - use bfs to traverse the btree level by level such that we can get the leftmost and the rightmost nodes' position
        diff = right pos - left pos + 1
    - if diff > res, override the result
