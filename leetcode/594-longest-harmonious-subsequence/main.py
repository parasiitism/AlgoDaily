"""
    1st approach: hashtable
    - count the occurence of each number
    - harmonic subsequence is actually the count[num] + count[num+1] or (count[num-1] + count[num])

    e.g. [1,2,1,3,0,0,2,2,1,3,3]

    [1,2,1,3,0,0,2,2,1,3,3]
               ^   ^ ^   ^ arrows represent the last occurence of each number
    
    count = {
        0: 2,
        1: 3,
        2: 3,
        3: 3,
    }

    the answer is count[2] + count[3] = 6

    2nd approach: hashtable, but in one pass
    - count the occurence of each number
    - simlar to 1st approach but since we are inside a loop we need to check the lower bound and the upperbound
