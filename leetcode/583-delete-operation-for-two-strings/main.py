    - are the cost of add, delete, remove the same? yes
    - will there be empty strings? yes

    dp meaning:

    edit    |   insert
    -------------------
    delete  |   newstring

    insert means: insert one chracter to the horizontal string to form the vertical string
    delete means: delete one chracter from the horizontal string to form the vertical string
    edit means  : edit one chracter on the horizontal string to form the vertical string
