/*
    1st: dynamic programming, hashtable
    - learned from others
    - longest increasing subsequnce but 2D because we want to store the diff between any arr[i] and arr[j]
    - similar to lc1027, 1218

    for each index, store a hashtable of diff : count of longest subsequence
    
    e.g. [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]

    id| num | hashtable
    0 | 20:  { } becomes { -5: 1}
    1 | 1:  { -19: 1 }
    2 | 15: { -5: 1, 14: 1 }
              ^^^^^
    Stop at here, we see that 20 is in fact in our dp, and dp[0][-5] doesnt exist, so we should add ht[-5] = 1 to dp[0]
    Then it becomes...
    2 | 15: { -5: 2, 14: 1 }
              ^^^^^
    3 | 3:  { -17: 1, 2: 1, -12: 1}
    4 | 10: { -10: 1, 9: 1, -5: 1.......again
                            ^^^^^
    Stop at here, we see that 15 is in fact in our dp, and dp[2][-5] also exists, so we can add dp[2][-5] to dp[4][-5]. 
    Then it becomes...
    4 | 10: { -10: 1, 9: 1, -5: 3, 7:1 }
                            ^^^^^
    5 | 5: { -15: 1, 4: 1, -10: 1, 2: 1, -5: 1.....again
    Stop at here, we see that 15 is in fact in our dp, and dp[4][-5] also exists, so we can add dp[4][-5] to dp[5][-5]. 
    Then it becomes...
    5 | 5: { -15: 1, 4: 1, -10: 1, 2: 1, -5: 4 }
