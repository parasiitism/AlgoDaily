"""
    1st approach: learned from others
    - the basic idea is to find the common prefix of m and n

    e.g.1
    m, n = 11, 15
    num,bit representation
    11  1011
    12  1100
    13  1101
    14  1110
    15  1111

    the common prefix is 1000 -> 8

    e.g.2
    m, n = 10, 11
    num,bit representation
    10  1010
    11  1011

    the common prefix is 1010 -> 10
