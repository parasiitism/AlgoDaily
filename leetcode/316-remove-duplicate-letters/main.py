"""
    1st approach: stack + hashtable
    - similar to leetcode331, 735, 901
    - first count the number of occurence for each character
    - then we use a stack to store the temp result as we move forward
        - when the current character is lexicographicallly less than stack[-1] and stack[-] still has occurence larger than 0, we pop the stack
    - we push the current character onto the stack
    - we can use a hashtable to indicate which characters are currently in the stack

    Time    O(n)
    Space   O(n)
    24 ms, faster than 82.50%
