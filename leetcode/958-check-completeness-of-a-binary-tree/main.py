    2nd approach:
	1. bfs and the queue finally should have all the leafs including null
	2. for a complete binary tree, there should not be any node after we met a null node in the final level

	e.g.1
				1
			2		3
		4 5	 6
	queue = [null, null, null, null, null, null, null]
	parent = 3		4	 4		5	 5		6	 6
	so it is complete

	e.g.2
				1
			2		3
		4 5	 		6
	queue = [null, 6, null, null, null, null]
	parent = 3	   3	4	4	   5	5

	Time	O(n)
	Space	O(h)
	0 ms, faster than 100.00%

	2nd approach: level order traversal
	- on a level, there are 2 possible reasons which make the binary tree not complete
		1. there is a null on my left(given that i am a non-null node)
		2. there is a null above my level(given that i am a non-null node)
